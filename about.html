        When I retired in 2017 I decided I wanted to use my time profittably. This led me to take a number of online courses. Notably Python programming, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm aspiring to become a freelance website developer.
        </p>
        <p class="mysay">I am now capable of creating websites. There are a number of hosting platforms on the market such as WIX, Go Daddy, Hostinger and numerous others. Subscription to such services enable a developer or even an individual to rapidly create a website. The caveate is that they are expensive and that the code never belongs to you.</p>
        <img id="Aimg1"  src="Assets\Luc.jpg" alt="Author's photograph">
        <p class="mysay">When someone wants to have a website the best solution is for that person or business to buy the domain themselves. That ensures the domain is your own. There is an anual fee, however whatever domain you select may be sold at a later time.</p>
        <p class="mysay">As a freelance web developer I am at your service 24/7 and assure you of my very best attention at all times. I'm an honest person, will charge the minimum fees and willing to answer all your questions. The most expensive part of your website is paying the hosting services of a company to host your site. This can range from ZAR 2000 to ZAR 3000 per year.</p>
        <p class="mysay">Job seekers should consider making their individual private websites that would include ALL their particulars, work experience, skills, certificates etc..The information can be stored in the cloud. There is a free website hosting service that you can use for as long as you are willing to forego a professional domain name. Contact me for more information on that.</p>
